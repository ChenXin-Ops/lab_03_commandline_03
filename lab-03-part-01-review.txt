==========
This lab will review downloading and uncompressing files, and it will get us set up for the remainder of the labs.
==========
==========
1. Go to your home directory.

Write the command that you used to do this below:
----------



==========
2. Prove that you're in your home directory.

Write the command that you used to do this - as well as its output - below :
----------



==========
3. Are there any directories or files in your directory that have the word mtec1003 in it?

root@DESKTOP-74C1NE3:/home/ChenXinLin# ls

Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Movies  Music  Pictures Mtec1003 textfile.txt

==========
4. If there are directories or files in your home directory that have the word mtec1002 in them, list them below (otherwise skip this step):
Mtec1003



==========
5. Delete these directories from your home folder by using this command:

$ rm -rf [name of directory/folder]

for example:

$ rm -rf mtec1003-labs-02

(skip if these directories don't exist)
----------



==========
6.  A compressed archive (.tar.gz) of the lab files can be found at this url: 

http://foureyes.github.io/mtec1002-spring2014/labs/03/mtec1002-lab-03.tar.gz

Download this file to your home directory into a file called mtec1002-lab-03.tar.gz.   Use a command that we learned to do this.

This command should have a *flag* to specify the output file.  MAKE SURE TO NAME YOUR OUTPUT FILE: mtec1002-lab-03.tar.gz

Write the command(s) that you used to download this file - as well as its output - below:
----------



==========
7.  Uncompress the file that you just downloaded.

 

==========
8.  You should now have a directory called mtec1002-lab-03 in your home directory.  Verify that this directory exists.

If the directory does not exist:

a. go to your home folder
b. go back to step 6

Otherwise...

Write the command(s) that you used to do this - as well as its output - below:
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Movies  Music  Pictures  mtec1002-lab-03  mtec1002-lab-03.tar  textfile.txt
root@DESKTOP-74C1NE3:/home/ChenXinLin# cd  mtec1002-lab-03
root@DESKTOP-74C1NE3:/home/ChenXinLin/mtec1002-lab-03# ls
books  logs  web


==========
9.  What directories are in the mtec1002-lab-03 folder?

root@DESKTOP-74C1NE3:/home/ChenXinLin/mtec1002-lab-03# ls
books  logs  web


==========
10.  Now... go back home.  Then change to the science-fiction directory using a relative path.  The directory is located in books... which is located in the mtec1002-lab-03 directory.  Verify you're in the right directory using pwd.

root@DESKTOP-74C1NE3:/home/ChenXinLin/mtec1002-lab-03# cd books/science-fiction/
root@DESKTOP-74C1NE3:/home/ChenXinLin/mtec1002-lab-03/books/science-fiction# pwd
/home/ChenXinLin/mtec1002-lab-03/books/science-fiction

11.  Write the files that are in the science fiction directory below.

Write the command(s) that you used to do this - as well as its output - below:

root@DESKTOP-74C1NE3:/home/ChenXinLin/mtec1002-lab-03/books/science-fiction# ls
pg84.txt  pg86.txt


==========
12.  Again, go back to your home directory.  Now... go to the science-fiction directory using an absolute path!  Verify that you're in the right directory using pwd.

Write the command(s) that you used to do this below:
root@DESKTOP-74C1NE3:~# pwd
/root
root@DESKTOP-74C1NE3:~# cd /home/ChenXinLin/mtec1002-lab-03/books/science-fiction/

==========
OPTIONAL
13. Immediately change back to the mtec1002-lab-03 folder with a single command using a *relative* path.

Write the command(s) that you used to do this below:
root@DESKTOP-74C1NE3:/home/ChenXinLin/mtec1002-lab-03/books/science-fiction# cd ../..
root@DESKTOP-74C1NE3:/home/ChenXinLin/mtec1002-lab-03# 

==========
OPTIONAL
14. Find out what the most recently modified directory is in mtec1002 (there are only 3 to choose from)?  How would you find this out?  Hint: perhaps using something to show the modified date... and sort it by time.

Write the command(s) that you used to do this below:
root@DESKTOP-74C1NE3:/home/ChenXinLin/mtec1002-lab-03# ls -l
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 501 staff 4096 Sep 23 19:58 books
drwxr-xr-x 1 501 staff 4096 Sep 23 19:58 logs
drwxr-xr-x 1 501 staff 4096 Feb 13  2013 web
==========
OPTIONAL
15. Create a compressed archive of the logs folder - that is... take the contents of logs and create a single archive (.tar), and compress (.gz)

Write the command(s) that you used to do this below:
root@DESKTOP-74C1NE3:/home/ChenXinLin/mtec1002-lab-03# tar -cvf logs.tar logs
